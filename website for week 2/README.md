# Week 2: HTML + CSS

This week, you'll be completing a lot of treehouse tutorials. These tutorials are excellent, engaging, and really help to demystify HTML, CSS, and the fundamentals of web design.

Remember that personal website you set up last week with github pages? By the end of the week, you'll know how to build that up into something quite good. Have fun!

## Websites vs Web Applications
Websites are static, meaning they are not updated, at least not all that often.

When someone says “website” you should think simple, single page sites or marketing websites. Websites are built using HTML, CSS, and maybe a little bit of JavaScript. No programming language is required, and neither is a database.

Websites are a huge part of the web and play super important functions like telling you today’s special at your local Italian meatball shop, or letting you know about a hot new startup that is about to launch.

Web applications are a whole different beast. Like desktop applications (Word, Photoshop, Skype), web applications are dynamic and ever-changing. Web applications rely on you to interact with them, whether by contributing content (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook) or by gathering data from other sources and presenting it to you (Mint, Google Analytics, Klout) or a little bit of both!  
  
When most people are talking about tech companies, they are usually talking about companies that create fancy custom web applications. **Like everything on the web, Web applications are built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript**, but they also use programming languages like PHP, Ruby, Python or C#, and frameworks like Rails, Django, CakePHP and .Net. Web applications almost always use databases, and because of that they are called dynamic.  

![Frontend vs backend](frontendvsbackend.jpeg)  

You know how the tip of an iceberg pokes out above the water, but they’re really hundreds of feet deep? That’s a lot like a web site.

The parts you see and interact with on a web site – the buttons, the dropdown menus and big bold fonts – make up the frontend.

The frontend of a web site has specific technologies attached to it. HTML makes up the text on the page, CSS makes it pretty, and JavaScript makes it interactive. All of these things happen in the browser.

The backend is everything that happens before it gets to your browser. If you’re booking a flight, that’s where prices are checked, itineraries are booked, and credit cards are charged. A backend can be very simple or very complicated.

A typical setup for a backend is a web server, an application and a database. The web server delivers a note to the application that you’d like to see all of the flights to Chicago. The application looks up the flights in the database, puts together a web page that lists them, and sends that web page back to your computer through the web server. That’s all the backend. Once your computer gets a hold of it, it’s the frontend.

For technologies used in the backend, anything goes. If a database stores your name or flight info, it might be MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or many others. Web pages could be put together with Python, Ruby on Rails, or PHP. The web server that sends those pages over to your computer might be Apache, Nginx, or IIS. The list goes on and on!


## To-Do:

1. Complete Treehouse's [How to Make a Website](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-website) course
  - Skip "Sharing a Website". We will be hosting our websites on github instead.
  
2. [Create Your Own Website](./create_your_own_website)

**Note**: 
- You can do both of these simultaneously. Instead of using Treehouse's workspaces, you can follow along with sublime text. In previous cohorts, students have used the site that Treehouse has you build as a starting point for their own. Feel free to do the same.
- It is not necessary to fork and clone this weeks work, but doing so will be good practice. Refer to last weeks [git challenge](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-week-1/tree/1b9b68cceb1c110cd20a860eeeb5c1bd9bb4ce73/git_practice) for the fork and clone workflow.   

#### Everyday
- Study + practice sublime text shortcuts [Mac](http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/sublime-text-2/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_osx.html) / [Windows/Linux](http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/sublime-text-2/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_win.html),
- Study + practice [terminal commands](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)

## Getting Help and Treehouse tips
- In addition to the slack community, be sure to use the [treehouse forum](https://teamtreehouse.com/forum) for tutorial related questions. The forum is very quick and answers are submitted 24/7. 
- adjust the [speed of playback](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/imgs/treehousespeed.jpg) to match your learning pace. 
 

## Highly suggested, but optional:

1. In Treehouse's [CSS Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics) course, complete the following modules:
  - The Box Model
  - Basic Layout
2. Complete Treehouse's [CSS - Beyond the Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-beyond-the-basics)
3. Complete Treehouse's [HTML Forms](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/html-forms) course
4. For extra kinesthetic practice: Code Academy's [HTML and CSS course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)

## Submitting your work

- You must complete the [week's submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/VZsU0WKZ6u) to turn in your work.
- The week's work is due each Sunday by 11:59pm.

**if you do not finish by the deadline:**

- Complete an extension request by emailing your facilitator. (There are a limited number of extensions available during phase-0)
- When complete, turn it in using the [week's submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/VZsU0WKZ6u)
